   <h5>Details</h5> 
   <p>Gleam Foundation is an initiative founded in 2018 by a team of individuals who endeavour to make great positive impact in the society. Its main objective is Empowerment for Transformation and it targets the young society (children and youth) ranging from the scholarly to the unscholarly. The team envisions positive, vibrant and visionary young society for a better tomorrow. The idea was born arising from the pitiful situation of the young people in our society: increasing suicide rates, increasing immoral activities, high unemployment rate, increased violence rates and so on. It was evident that the young cohort of the society was drowning. Therefore this initiative was aimed at saving the youth, awakening them to reality.</p> 
   <h6>Ativities</h6> 
   <p>It’s activities range from a very general approach towards more specific approaches. General approach involves basic ways of nurturing hope. These include such services as motivational, counselling, life coaching, career talks etc. (both direct and indirect e.g. online outreach, publications, videos, music and such) More specific approach depends on the situation of our client. This may involve: platforms for talent nurturing, sponsorship programmes, job offers, development opportunities such as children’s homes and more of such. </p> 
 
   <p> Our most basic target groups are pupils and students: primary, secondary and postsecondary, since this is where the most scholarly (the learning) are found and that this is the team that is most capable to make a move to make the world a better place to live in. Gleam Foundation is therefore open to calls to schools for motivational talks, counselling services, career talks and more of that kind. The members can be reached via the contact details given. The other target groups are accessed by our outreach programme, these include the less scholarly or the unscholarly and the disadvantaged of the young society such as orphans, street children, and other victims of life circumstances. </p>
